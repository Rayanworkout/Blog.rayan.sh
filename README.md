## Personal Blog & CMS built with VueJS and Django as API backend.

### Articles can be added in Django admin page in markdown format. They are rendered as HTML, including code blocks with syntax highlighting.

#### User can filter existing articles by category or name.

#### The apache configuration is available in the repo as well as a whole script to automate the CI/CD pipeline.

#### The API used could have been Flask but I needed Django admin panel to easily add Articles.
